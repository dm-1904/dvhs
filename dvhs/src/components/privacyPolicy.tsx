      <p>
        <strong>Express Written Consent</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting your contact information, you are providing your express
        written consent to receive communications from us at the email address
        and telephone numbers you entered into our contact form, or that you
        later provide to us or enter into your contact page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>E-mails, Calls, and Texts</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These communications may include telemarketing messages, through the use
        of email, landline phone, fax, cellular phone, and text messages
        (including sms and mms). Autodialing. We may use an automatic telephone
        dialing system (or “auto-dialer”), which may employ an artificial or
        pre-recorded voice or “robotexts.” Your carrier’s standard rates and
        charges may apply. No Purchase Necessary. Agreeing to these
        communications is not a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or
        services from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Revoking Consent and Opting Out</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You may revoke your consent to receive communications at any time by
        replying “stop” to any of our texts, or by any other reasonable means.
        We will make a commercially reasonable effort to comply with any
        communications from you opting out, but reply “stop” will automatically
        revoke your consent to further text communications, and we recommend
        that method. We may take up to 30 days to stop communications if you use
        a method other than the automatic reply “stop.” You consent to receive a
        final text message confirming your opt-out. You may revoke your consent
        to receive email communications by using the “unsubscribe” link in an
        email or by any other reasonable means. We will make a commercially
        reasonable effort to comply with any communications from you opting out
        of email, but “unsubscribe” will automatically revoke your consent to
        further email communications, and we recommend that method. We may take
        up to 30 days to stop email communications if you use a method other
        than “unsubscribe”.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Communication Frequency</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How often we send you communications will vary, because the real estate
        professional who communicates with you will determine it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your consent here also serves as your express written consent to
        electronic communications from us in the past.

        </li>
        <li>
          You have not registered on a national or statewide Do Not Call list,

          Additional Communications Provisions (FOR CANADIAN RESIDENTS)
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the consent provided above in the Our Communications With
        You (United States) section, Canadian residents agree to the following
        provisions related to compliance with Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation
        (“CASL”), Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic
        Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) and Canadian provincial law including Alberta’

          information that are found in our Privacy Policy.

          longer considering real estate opportunities.

          Dispute Resolution - Arbitration Agreement (Mandatory Binding
          Arbitration and Class Action Waiver)
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT WILL HAVE A
          SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW LEGAL CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH
          OTHER ARE RESOLVED. For example, if we elect to require you to
          arbitrate any claim, you will not have the right to a jury trial or
          the right to participate in a class action in court or in arbitration.
          Binding arbitration lets an independent third party resolve a Claim
          without using the court system, judges, or juries. Either you or we
          may require the submission of a Claim to binding arbitration at any
          reasonable time, even if a lawsuit or other proceeding has begun. If
          either you or we don't submit to binding arbitration following a
          lawful demand, the one who fails to so submit bears all costs and
          expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by the
          other in compelling arbitration.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither you nor we will be entitled to: <br /> Join, consolidate, or
        combine Claims by or against others in any arbitration; or <br />
        Include in any arbitration any Claims as a representative or member of a
        class; or <br />
        Act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a
        private attorney general capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AS DESCRIBED
          BELOW. If you do not reject this Arbitration Agreement and a Claim is
          arbitrated, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) have a
          court or a jury decide the Claim; (2) engage in information-gathering
          (discovery) to the same extent as in court; (3) participate in a class
          action, private attorney general or other representative action in
          court or in arbitration; or (4) join or consolidate a Claim with
          claims of any other person. The right to appeal is more limited in
          arbitration than in court and other rights in court may be unavailable
          or limited in arbitration.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This Arbitration Agreement describes when and how a Claim (as defined
        below) arising under or related to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
        between you and us may be arbitrated. Arbitration is a method of
        resolving disputes in front of one or more neutral persons, instead of
        having a trial in court in front of a judge and/or jury. If a claim is
        arbitrated, each party waives its, his or her respective rights to a
        trial before a jury in connection with the Claim. It can be a quicker
        and simpler way to resolve disputes. As solely used in this Arbitration
        Agreement, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” mean “us” as defined above,
        our parent companies, wholly or majority owned subsidiaries, affiliates,
        commonly-owned companies, management companies, successors, assigns and
        any of their employees, officers and directors. For purposes of this
        Arbitration Agreement, these terms also mean any third party providing
        any goods or services in connection with the Terms of Use and Privacy
        Policy, if such third party is named as a party by you in any lawsuit
        between you and us.
