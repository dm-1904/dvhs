        These communications may include telemarketing messages, through the use
        of email, landline phone, fax, cellular phone, and text messages
        (including sms and mms). Autodialing. We may use an automatic telephone
        dialing system (or “auto-dialer”), which may employ an artificial or
        pre-recorded voice or “robotexts.” Your carrier’s standard rates and
        charges may apply. No Purchase Necessary. Agreeing to these
        communications is not a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or

        You may revoke your consent to receive communications at any time by
        replying “stop” to any of our texts, or by any other reasonable means.
        We will make a commercially reasonable effort to comply with any
        communications from you opting out, but reply “stop” will automatically
        revoke your consent to further text communications, and we recommend
        that method. We may take up to 30 days to stop communications if you use
        a method other than the automatic reply “stop.” You consent to receive a

        to receive email communications by using the “unsubscribe” link in an
        email or by any other reasonable means. We will make a commercially
        reasonable effort to comply with any communications from you opting out
        of email, but “unsubscribe” will automatically revoke your consent to
        further email communications, and we recommend that method. We may take
        up to 30 days to stop email communications if you use a method other
        than “unsubscribe”.

          Dispute Resolution - Arbitration Agreement (Mandatory Binding
          Arbitration and Class Action Waiver)
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT WILL HAVE A
          SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW LEGAL CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH
          OTHER ARE RESOLVED. For example, if we elect to require you to
          arbitrate any claim, you will not have the right to a jury trial or
          the right to participate in a class action in court or in arbitration.
          Binding arbitration lets an independent third party resolve a Claim
          without using the court system, judges, or juries. Either you or we
          may require the submission of a Claim to binding arbitration at any
          reasonable time, even if a lawsuit or other proceeding has begun. If
          either you or we don't submit to binding arbitration following a
          lawful demand, the one who fails to so submit bears all costs and
          expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by the
          other in compelling arbitration.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither you nor we will be entitled to: <br /> Join, consolidate, or
        combine Claims by or against others in any arbitration; or <br />
        Include in any arbitration any Claims as a representative or member of a
        class; or <br />
        Act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a
        private attorney general capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AS DESCRIBED
          BELOW. If you do not reject this Arbitration Agreement and a Claim is
          arbitrated, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) have a
          court or a jury decide the Claim; (2) engage in information-gathering
          (discovery) to the same extent as in court; (3) participate in a class
          action, private attorney general or other representative action in
          court or in arbitration; or (4) join or consolidate a Claim with
          claims of any other person. The right to appeal is more limited in
          arbitration than in court and other rights in court may be unavailable
          or limited in arbitration.

      </p>
      <p>
        This Arbitration Agreement describes when and how a Claim (as defined
        below) arising under or related to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
        between you and us may be arbitrated. Arbitration is a method of
        resolving disputes in front of one or more neutral persons, instead of
        having a trial in court in front of a judge and/or jury. If a claim is
        arbitrated, each party waives its, his or her respective rights to a
        trial before a jury in connection with the Claim. It can be a quicker
        and simpler way to resolve disputes. As solely used in this Arbitration
        Agreement, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” mean “us” as defined above,
        our parent companies, wholly or majority owned subsidiaries, affiliates,
        commonly-owned companies, management companies, successors, assigns and
        any of their employees, officers and directors. For purposes of this
        Arbitration Agreement, these terms also mean any third party providing
        any goods or services in connection with the Terms of Use and Privacy
        Policy, if such third party is named as a party by you in any lawsuit
        between you and us.

        between you and us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>a. Your Right to Reject Arbitration: </strong>You may reject
        this Agreement by mailing a rejection notice to 17310 W Wildwood St.
        Surprise, AZ 85388, Attn. Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Arbitration
        Rejection, within 30 days after you agree to these terms of use. Any
        rejection notice must include your name, address and telephone number;
        the date you agreed to the Terms of Use that your rejection notice
        applies to; and your signature. Your rejection notice will apply only to
        this Agreement in the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but will not
        affect any term of any other contract between you and us (including
        without limitation any prior or subsequent agreement), nor will it
        change your obligation to arbitrate claims or matters covered by any
        prior or subsequent agreement to arbitrate, including each agreement to
        arbitrate that arises pursuant to the Terms of Use on the Company’s
        website which is not the subject of a valid rejection notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>b. What Claims Are Covered: </strong>“Claim” means any claim,
        dispute or controversy between you and us, whether preexisting, present
        or future, that in any way arises from or relates to the Terms of Use or
        Privacy Policy, your use of this website, your Account, any transaction
        in your Account, the events leading up to the Terms of Use or Privacy
        Policy (for example, any disclosures, advertisements, promotions or oral
        or written statements, warranties or representations made by us),
        communications between you and us and the manner of communicating, any
        product or service provided by us or third parties in connection with
        the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, the collection of amounts due and
        the manner of collection, enforcement of any and all of the obligations
        a party hereto may have to another party, compliance with applicable
        laws and/or regulations (including but not limited to the Telephone
        Consumer Protection Act), or the relationships resulting from any of the
        foregoing. “Claim” has the broadest possible meaning, and includes
        initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims and
        federal, state, local and administrative claims and claims which arose
        before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. It includes
        disputes based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other
        intentional torts, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common
        law and equity and claims for money damages and injunctive or
        declaratory relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, “Claim” does not include: (i) any dispute or controversy about
        the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this Arbitration
        Agreement or any part thereof (including, without limitation, the Class
        Action Waiver set forth below, subparts (A) and (B) of the part (k) set
        forth below titled “Rules of Interpretation” and/or this sentence); all
        such disputes or controversies are for a court and not an arbitrator to
        decide; but disputes about the validity or enforceability of the Terms
        of Use or Privacy Policy as a whole are for the arbitrator and not a
        court to decide; (ii) seeking and obtaining from a court of competent
        jurisdiction (notwithstanding ongoing arbitration and without waiver of
        rights under this Arbitration Agreement) provisional or ancillary
        remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, temporary
        restraining orders, property preservation orders, foreclosure,
        sequestration, eviction, attachment, replevin, garnishment, and/or the
        appointment of a receiver; (iii) the exercising of any self-help or
        non-judicial remedies by you or us; (iv) any individual action in court
        by one party that is limited to preventing the other party from using a
        self-help remedy and that does not involve a request for damages or
        monetary relief of any kind; or (v) any individual action brought by you
        against us in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, if
        any. But if that action is transferred, removed or appealed to a
        different court, we then have the right to choose arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          c. Electing Arbitration; Starting an Arbitration Proceeding:{" "}
        </strong>
        Either you or we may elect to arbitrate a Claim by giving the other
        party written notice of the intent to arbitrate the Claim or by filing a
        motion to compel arbitration of the Claim. This notice may be given
        before or after a lawsuit has been filed concerning the Claim or with
        respect to other Claims brought later in the lawsuit, and it may be
        given by papers filed in the lawsuit, such as a motion to compel
        arbitration. Each of the arbitration administrators listed below has
        specific rules for starting an arbitration proceeding. Regardless of who
        elected arbitration or how arbitration was elected, the party asserting
        the Claim (i.e., the party seeking money damages or other relief from a
        court or an arbitrator) is responsible for starting the arbitration
        proceeding. Thus, if you assert a Claim against us in court, and we
        elect to arbitrate that Claim by filing a motion to compel arbitration
        which is granted by the court, you will be responsible for starting the
        arbitration proceeding. Similarly, if we assert a Claim against you in
        court, you assert a counterclaim against us, and we elect to arbitrate
        that counterclaim by filing a motion to compel arbitration which is
        granted by the court, you will be responsible for starting the
        arbitration proceeding. Even if all parties have opted to litigate a
        Claim in court, you or we may elect arbitration with respect to any
        Claim made by a new party or any Claim later asserted by a party in that
        or any related or unrelated lawsuit (including a Claim initially
        asserted on an individual basis but modified to be asserted on a class,
        representative or multi-party basis). Nothing in that litigation shall
        constitute a waiver of any rights under this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>d. Class Action Waiver: </strong>Notwithstanding any other
        provision of the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, if either you or we
        elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right: (a)
        to participate in a class action, private attorney general action or
        other representative action in court or in arbitration, either as a
        class representative or class member; or (b) to join or consolidate
        Claims with claims of any other persons. No arbitrator shall have
        authority to conduct any arbitration in violation of this provision or
        to issue any relief that applies to any person or entity other than you
        and/or us individually. (Provided, however, that the Class Action Waiver
        does not apply to any lawsuit or administrative proceeding filed against
        us by a state or federal government agency even when such agency is
        seeking relief on behalf of a class of borrowers including you. This
        means that we will not have the right to compel arbitration of any claim
        brought by such an agency).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>e. Location of Arbitration: </strong>Any arbitration will take
        place in the county where you reside or at another mutually agreed
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>f. Cost of Arbitration:</strong>Each Administrator charges fees
        to administer an arbitration proceeding and the arbitrator also charges
        fees. This includes fees not charged by a court. At your written
        request, we will pay all filing, hearing and/or other fees charged by
        the Administrator and arbitrator to you for Claim(s) asserted by you in
        an individual arbitration after you have paid an amount equivalent to
        the fee, if any, for filing such Claim(s) in state or federal court
        (whichever is less) in the judicial district in which you reside. (If
        you have already paid a filing fee for asserting the Claim(s) in court,
        you will not be required to pay that amount again). In addition, the
        administrator may have a procedure whereby you can seek a waiver of fees
        charged to you by the Administrator and arbitrator. We will always pay
        any fees or expenses that we are required to pay by law or the
        Administrator’s rules or that we are required to pay for this
        Arbitration Agreement to be enforced. With respect to Claim(s) asserted
        by you in an individual arbitration, we will pay your reasonable
        attorney, witness and expert fees and costs if and to the extent you
        prevail, if applicable law requires us to or if we must bear such fees
        and costs in order for this Arbitration Agreement to be enforced. We
        will not ask you to pay or reimburse us for any fees we pay the
        Administrator or the arbitrator or for our attorneys’ fees and costs
        unless (1) the arbitrator finds that you have acted in bad faith (as
        measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
        11(b)), and (2) this power does not make this Arbitration Agreement
        invalid. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator must
        provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the award.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>g. Governing Law: </strong>The Terms of Use or Privacy Policy
        evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and, therefore,
        this Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
        U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), and not by any state arbitration law.
        The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and
        evidence that would apply in a court, or by state or local laws that
        relate to arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator will apply the same
        statutes of limitation and privileges that a court would apply if the
        matter were pending in court. The arbitrator will have the authority to
        hear and rule on appropriate dispositive motions for judgment on the
        pleadings, for failure to state a claim, or for full or partial summary
        judgment. All parties (the AAA/JAMS, the arbitrators, you and we) must,
        to the extent feasible, take any action necessary to ensure that an
        arbitration proceeding, as described in this Arbitration Agreement, is
        completed within 180 days of filing the Claim with the AAA or JAMS. This
        provision will be liberally construed to ensure the enforcement of this
        Arbitration Agreement. In determining liability or awarding damages or
        other relief, the arbitrator will follow the applicable substantive law,
        consistent with the FAA that would apply if the matter had been brought
        in court. The arbitrator may award any damages or other relief or
        remedies that would apply under applicable law to an individual action
        brought in court, including, without limitation, punitive damages (which
        shall be governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the
        courts) and injunctive, equitable and declaratory relief (but only in
        favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
        necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim).
        The arbitrator will have the authority to award fees and costs of
        attorneys, witnesses and experts to the extent permitted by the Terms of
        Use or Privacy Policy, the Administrator’s rules or applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>h. Right to Discovery: </strong>In addition to the parties’
        rights to obtain discovery pursuant to the arbitration rules of the
        Administrator, either party may submit a written request to the
        arbitrator to expand the scope of discovery normally allowable under the
        arbitration rules of the Administrator. The arbitrator shall have
        discretion to grant or deny that request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>i. Arbitration Result and Right of Appeal: </strong>Judgment
        upon the award given by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
        having jurisdiction. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding,
        except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA. The arbitrator’s
        authority shall be limited to deciding the case submitted by the parties
        to the arbitration. Therefore, no decision by any arbitrator shall serve
        as precedent in other arbitrations except in a dispute between the same
        parties, in which case it could be used to preclude the same claim from
        being re-arbitrated. If the amount of the Claim exceeds $25,000, any
        party can, within 30 days after the entry of the award by the
        arbitrator, appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by
        the Administrator. (If an appeal is not filed within that time period,
        the arbitration award shall become final and binding). The panel shall
        reconsider de novo (anew) any aspect of the initial award requested by
        the appealing party. This means that they shall reach their own findings
        of fact and conclusions of law rather than deferring in any manner to
        the original arbitrator. The decision of the panel shall be by majority
        vote. Reference in this Arbitration Agreement to “the arbitrator” shall
        mean the panel if an appeal of the arbitrator’s decision has been taken.
        The costs of such an appeal will be borne in accordance with
        subparagraph (g) above, captioned “Cost of Arbitration.” Any final
        decision of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as
        provided under the FAA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>j. Rules of Interpretation: </strong>This Arbitration Agreement
        shall survive the termination, cancellation or suspension of the Terms
        of Use or Privacy Policy, any legal proceeding, and any bankruptcy by
        you, to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. In the
        event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Arbitration Agreement,
        on the one hand, and the applicable arbitration rules or the other
        provisions of the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, on the other hand,
        this Arbitration Agreement shall govern. If any portion of this
        Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not
        invalidate the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy or the remaining portions
        of this Arbitration Agreement, except that:
      </p>
      <p>
        (A) The parties acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and
        essential to the arbitration of any disputes between them and is
        non-severable from this Arbitration Agreement. If the Class Action
        Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then this Arbitration
        Agreement (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect
        to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or
        invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. The parties acknowledge and
        agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated; and
      </p>
      <p>
        (B) If a Claim is brought seeking public injunctive relief and a court
        determines that the restrictions in the Class Action Waiver or elsewhere
        in this Arbitration Agreement prohibiting the arbitrator from awarding
        relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with respect to such
        Claim (and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been
        exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in
        court and any individual Claims seeking monetary relief will be
        arbitrated. In such a case the parties will request that the court stay
        the Claim for public injunctive relief until the arbitration award
        pertaining to individual relief has been entered in court. In no event
        will a Claim for public injunctive relief be arbitrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>k. Notice of Claim; Right to Resolve; Special Payment: </strong>
        Prior to initiating, joining or participating in any judicial or
        arbitration proceeding regarding any Claim, the Claimant (the party who
        asserts or seeks to assert a Claim in a lawsuit or arbitration
        proceeding) shall give the other party written notice of the Claim (a
        "Claim Notice") and a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 days, to
        resolve the Claim. Any Claim Notice you send must include your name,
        address, telephone number and loan or account number. Any Claim Notice
        must explain the nature of the Claim and the relief that is demanded.
        You may only submit a Claim Notice on your own behalf and not on behalf
        of any other party. The Claimant must reasonably cooperate in providing
        any information about the Claim that the other party reasonably
        requests. If: (i) you submit a Claim Notice in accordance with this
        paragraph on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party);
        (ii) we refuse to provide the relief you request before an arbitrator is
        appointed; and (iii) an arbitrator subsequently determines that you were
        entitled to such relief (or greater relief), the arbitrator shall award
        you at least $7,500 (not including any arbitration fees and attorneys'
        fees and costs to which you may be entitled under this Arbitration
        Agreement or applicable law). We encourage you to address all Claims you
        have in a single Claim Notice and/or a single arbitration. Accordingly,
        this $7,500 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims
        you have asserted or could have asserted in the arbitration, and
        multiple awards of $7,500 are not contemplated by this Section.
      </p>
      <p>

        <strong>Web Analytics and Web Session Recording Technologies:</strong>
        The Company uses industry standard web analytics to track web visits. We
        and third parties also use tools that enable us to track certain aspects
        of a user’s visit to our websites. These technologies help us better
        manage content on our websites by informing us what content is
        effective, how consumers engage with our websites, and how consumers
        arrive at and/or depart from our websites. The software typically uses
        two methods to track user activity: (1) “tracking pixels” and (2) “clear
        gifs.” Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded
        in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are
        viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear
        gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web
        pages and email messages that track whether a user views a web page or
        email message. User activity information may be associated with
        additional information about a user’s session and Personal Information,
        if provided by the user. To better assess and optimize our marketing
        activities, we may use a tool called the “Metal Pixel” operated by Meta
        (formerly Facebook). Facebook is able to determine the visitors of our
        online offers as a target group for the presentation of advertisements
        (so-called “Facebook ads”). Accordingly, we use the Meta pixel to
        display our Facebook ads only to Facebook users who have shown an
        interest in our website or who have specific characteristicsthat we
        submit to Facebook. Meta pixel allows us to ensure that Facebook ads are
        in line with the potential interest of users. Meta pixel also allows us
        to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market
        research purposes by seeing whether users have been redirected to our
        website after clicking on a Facebook ad. The Meta pixel may be directly
        integrated into our website by Facebook and can store a cookie on your
        device. If you then log in to Facebook or visit Facebook when you are
        logged in, your visit to our online offer will be noted in your profile.
        The data collected about you is anonymous for us, i. e. it does not
        allow us to draw conclusions about the identity of the users. However,
        the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that it can be linked to
        the respective user profile and used by Facebook as well as for its own
        market research and advertising purposes. If we transfer data to
        Facebook for comparison purposes, it is encrypted locally in the browser
        and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection. This is
        done with the sole purpose of matching the data encrypted by Facebook.
        For more information about Facebook’s policies and practices, please
        seethe Facebook Data Usage Policy at:
        https://www.facebook.com/policy.php. For specific information and
        details about the Facebook pixel and how it works, visit the Facebook
        Help Center at: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616.
        Your use of our website implies your consent to the use of Meta Pixel.
        You may manage your preferences or opt out of data collection through
        Metal Pixel by vising and following the instructions on how to set up
        use-based advertising at: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads. We
        may use technologies for the following purposes across our websites: We
        use developer tools that allow us to collect information that enables us
        to diagnose and resolve bugs or user issues with our websites. We also
        use services to monitor and improve our services by helping us better
        understand our users experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which
        pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like,
        etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user
        feedback. These services use cookies and other technologies to collect
        data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's

        browser information, geographic location (country only), and the
        preferred language used to display our website. We may use a tool called
        "Fullstory" to monitor and improve our services. FullStory is a
        technology service that helps us better understand our users experience
        (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose

        <strong>Chat Bot Technology.</strong>We may also use third-party service
        providers to provide chat services for our clients to communicate with
        us regarding your account, payments, and other general questions you may
        have. As you navigate our websites and use the chat systems with us, we
        attempt to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible. However,
        some of the information that we receive through this website and your
        interactions with the chat systems may be tracked, such as the date you
        communicate with us, the last day you contacted us, and other messages,
        comments and conversations made through the chat messages. The chat
        system collects the information that you voluntarily type in the chat
        bot when you initiate a query through the chat system and respond to a
        query from the chat system. Additionally, when you are using our chat
        system, it collects interactions that you have made into the chat system
        while communicating with a customer service representative. This data is
        used to understand your preferences, provide personalized responses, and
        enhance the performance and functionality of the chat bot. We may retain
        this information for a reasonable period unless you request its
        deletion. You can maximize the benefits of your privacy partnership with

        identifiable information with us through our website. Third party chat
        bot systems may capture, record, or analyze your chat bot communications
        with us. Through our chat bot services, we may use AI technology (“Bot”)
        to power the chat functionality which is intended to provide immediate
        responses to your questions. While we have made every effort to ensure
        that the Bot provides accurate and up-to-date information, please
        understand that it may not be able to address more complex queries fully
        and sometimes, it might even give a completely wrong answer. The
        information provided by the Bot should not be solely relied upon for
        making critical decisions or resolving complex issues. Users are
        responsible for verifying and cross-referencing the information provided
        and should exercise caution and judgment when relying on its responses.
        Under no circumstances shall Commissions, Inc. be liable for any direct,

        or in connection with the use of the chat bots on its websites. This
        includes, without limitation, any damage, loss, or injury caused by
        error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or
        transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or
        destruction, or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of the
        chat bot. While we make efforts to ensure the availability and
        reliability of the chat bot, there may be instances where it is
        unavailable or experiences technical issues. Deal Landers Arizona
