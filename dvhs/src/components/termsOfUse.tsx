          DISPUTE RESOLUTION - ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <br />
          (Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver)
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL
        IMPACT ON HOW LEGAL CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE
        RESOLVED. For example, if we elect to require you to arbitrate any
        claim, you will not have the right to a jury trial or the right to
        participate in a class action in court or in arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Binding arbitration lets an independent third party resolve a Claim
          without using the court system, judges, or juries. Either you or we
          may require the submission of a Claim to binding arbitration at any
          reasonable time, even if a lawsuit or other proceeding has begun. If
          either you or we don't submit to binding arbitration following a
          lawful demand, the one who fails to so submit bears all costs and
          expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by the
          other in compelling arbitration.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Neither you nor we will be entitled to:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Join, consolidate, or combine Claims by or against others in any
            arbitration; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Include in any arbitration any Claims as a representative or member
            of a class; or

          <li>
            Act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a
            private attorney general capacity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AS DESCRIBED
        BELOW. If you do not reject this Arbitration Agreement and a Claim is
        arbitrated, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) have a court
        or a jury decide the Claim; (2) engage in information-gathering
        (discovery) to the same extent as in court; (3) participate in a class
        action, private attorney general or other representative action in court
        or in arbitration; or (4) join or consolidate a Claim with claims of any
        other person. The right to appeal is more limited in arbitration than in
        court and other rights in court may be unavailable or limited in
        arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Arbitration Agreement describes when and how a Claim (as defined
        below) arising under or related to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
        between you and us may be arbitrated. Arbitration is a method of
        resolving disputes in front of one or more neutral persons, instead of
        having a trial in court in front of a judge and/or jury. If a claim is
        arbitrated, each party waives its, his or her respective rights to a
        trial before a jury in connection with the Claim. It can be a quicker
        and simpler way to resolve disputes. As solely used in this Arbitration
        Agreement, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” mean “us” as defined above,
        our parent companies, wholly or majority owned subsidiaries, affiliates,
        commonly-owned companies, management companies, successors, assigns and
        any of their employees, officers and directors. For purposes of this
        Arbitration Agreement, these terms also mean any third party providing
        any goods or services in connection with the Terms of Use and Privacy
        Policy, if such third party is named as a party by you in any lawsuit
        between you and us.
      </p>
      <p>
        a. Your Right to Reject Arbitration: You may reject this Agreement by
        mailing a rejection notice to 17310 W Wildwood St. Surprise, AZ 85388,
        Attn. Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Arbitration Rejection, within 30
        days after you agree to these Terms of Use. Any rejection notice must
        include your name, address and telephone number; the date you agreed to
        the Terms of Use that your rejection notice applies to; and your
        signature. Your rejection notice will apply only to this Agreement in
        the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but will not affect any term of any
        other contract between you and us (including without limitation any
        prior or subsequent agreement), nor will it change your obligation to
        arbitrate claims or matters covered by any prior or subsequent agreement
        to arbitrate, including each agreement to arbitrate that arises pursuant
        to the Terms of Use on the Company’s website which is not the subject of
        a valid rejection notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. What Claims Are Covered: “Claim” means any claim, dispute or
        controversy between you and us, whether preexisting, present or future,
        that in any way arises from or relates to the Terms of Use or Privacy
        Policy, your use of this website, your Account, any transaction in your
        Account, the events leading up to the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy
        (for example, any disclosures, advertisements, promotions or oral or
        written statements, warranties or representations made by us),
        communications between you and us and the manner of communicating, any
        product or service provided by us or third parties in connection with
        the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, the collection of amounts due and
        the manner of collection, enforcement of any and all of the obligations
        a party hereto may have to another party, compliance with applicable
        laws and/or regulations (including but not limited to the Telephone
        Consumer Protection Act), or the relationships resulting from any of the
        foregoing. “Claim” has the broadest possible meaning, and includes
        initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims and
        federal, state, local and administrative claims and claims which arose
        before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. It includes
        disputes based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other
        intentional torts, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common
        law and equity and claims for money damages and injunctive or
        declaratory relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, “Claim” does not include: (i) any dispute or controversy about
        the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this Arbitration
        Agreement or any part thereof (including, without limitation, the Class
        Action Waiver set forth below, subparts (A) and (B) of the part (k) set
        forth below titled “Rules of Interpretation” and/or this sentence); all
        such disputes or controversies are for a court and not an arbitrator to
        decide; but disputes about the validity or enforceability of the Terms
        of Use or Privacy Policy as a whole are for the arbitrator and not a
        court to decide; (ii) seeking and obtaining from a court of competent
        jurisdiction (notwithstanding ongoing arbitration and without waiver of
        rights under this Arbitration Agreement) provisional or ancillary
        remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, temporary
        restraining orders, property preservation orders, foreclosure,
        sequestration, eviction, attachment, replevin, garnishment, and/or the
        appointment of a receiver; (iii) the exercising of any self-help or
        non-judicial remedies by you or us; (iv) any individual action in court
        by one party that is limited to preventing the other party from using a
        self-help remedy and that does not involve a request for damages or
        monetary relief of any kind; or (v) any individual action brought by you
        against us in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, if
        any. But if that action is transferred, removed or appealed to a
        different court, we then have the right to choose arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. Electing Arbitration; Starting an Arbitration Proceeding: Either you
        or we may elect to arbitrate a Claim by giving the other party written
        notice of the intent to arbitrate the Claim or by filing a motion to
        compel arbitration of the Claim. This notice may be given before or
        after a lawsuit has been filed concerning the Claim or with respect to
        other Claims brought later in the lawsuit, and it may be given by papers
        filed in the lawsuit, such as a motion to compel arbitration. Each of
        the arbitration administrators listed below has specific rules for
        starting an arbitration proceeding. Regardless of who elected
        arbitration or how arbitration was elected, the party asserting the
        Claim (i.e., the party seeking money damages or other relief from a
        court or an arbitrator) is responsible for starting the arbitration
        proceeding. Thus, if you assert a Claim against us in court, and we
        elect to arbitrate that Claim by filing a motion to compel arbitration
        which is granted by the court, you will be responsible for starting the
        arbitration proceeding. Similarly, if we assert a Claim against you in
        court, you assert a counterclaim against us, and we elect to arbitrate
        that counterclaim by filing a motion to compel arbitration which is
        granted by the court, you will be responsible for starting the
        arbitration proceeding. Even if all parties have opted to litigate a
        Claim in court, you or we may elect arbitration with respect to any
        Claim made by a new party or any Claim later asserted by a party in that
        or any related or unrelated lawsuit (including a Claim initially
        asserted on an individual basis but modified to be asserted on a class,
        representative or multi-party basis). Nothing in that litigation shall
        constitute a waiver of any rights under this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. Class Action Waiver: Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms
        of Use or Privacy Policy, if either you or we elect to arbitrate a
        Claim, neither you nor we will have the right: (a) to participate in a
        class action, private attorney general action or other representative
        action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or
        class member; or (b) to join or consolidate Claims with claims of any
        other persons. No arbitrator shall have authority to conduct any
        arbitration in violation of this provision or to issue any relief that
        applies to any person or entity other than you and/or us individually.
        (Provided, however, that the Class Action Waiver does not apply to any
        lawsuit or administrative proceeding filed against us by a state or
        federal government agency even when such agency is seeking relief on
        behalf of a class of borrowers including you. This means that we will
        not have the right to compel arbitration of any claim brought by such an
        agency).
      </p>
      <p>
        e. Location of Arbitration: Any arbitration hearing that you attend must
        take place at a location reasonably convenient to your residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        f. Cost of Arbitration: Each Administrator charges fees to administer an
        arbitration proceeding and the arbitrator also charges fees. This
        includes fees not charged by a court. At your written request, we will
        pay all filing, hearing and/or other fees charged by the Administrator
        and arbitrator to you for Claim(s) asserted by you in an individual
        arbitration after you have paid an amount equivalent to the fee, if any,
        for filing such Claim(s) in state or federal court (whichever is less)
        in the judicial district in which you reside. (If you have already paid
        a filing fee for asserting the Claim(s) in court, you will not be
        required to pay that amount again). In addition, the administrator may
        have a procedure whereby you can seek a waiver of fees charged to you by
        the Administrator and arbitrator. We will always pay any fees or
        expenses that we are required to pay by law or the Administrator’s rules
        or that we are required to pay for this Arbitration Agreement to be
        enforced.With respect to Claim(s) asserted by you in an individual
        arbitration, we will pay your reasonable attorney, witness and expert
        fees and costs if and to the extent you prevail, if applicable law
        requires us to or if we must bear such fees and costs in order for this
        Arbitration Agreement to be enforced. We will not ask you to pay or
        reimburse us for any fees we pay the Administrator or the arbitrator or
        for our attorneys’ fees and costs unless (1) the arbitrator finds that
        you have acted in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in
        Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), and (2) this power does not make
        this Arbitration Agreement invalid. At the timely request of either
        party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the
        basis for the award.
      </p>
      <p>
        g. Governing Law: The Terms of Use or Privacy Policy evidences a
        transaction involving interstate commerce and, therefore, this
        Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
        U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), and not by any state arbitration law.
        The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and
        evidence that would apply in a court, or by state or local laws that
        relate to arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator will apply the same
        statutes of limitation and privileges that a court would apply if the
        matter were pending in court. The arbitrator will have the authority to
        hear and rule on appropriate dispositive motions for judgment on the
        pleadings, for failure to state a claim, or for full or partial summary
        judgment. All parties (the AAA/JAMS, the arbitrators, you and we) must,
        to the extent feasible, take any action necessary to ensure that an
        arbitration proceeding, as described in this Arbitration Agreement, is
        completed within 180 days of filing the Claim with the AAA or JAMS. This
        provision will be liberally construed to ensure the enforcement of this
        Arbitration Agreement.In determining liability or awarding damages or
        other relief, the arbitrator will follow the applicable substantive law,
        consistent with the FAA that would apply if the matter had been brought
        in court. The arbitrator may award any damages or other relief or
        remedies that would apply under applicable law to an individual action
        brought in court, including, without limitation, punitive damages (which
        shall be governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the
        courts) and injunctive, equitable and declaratory relief (but only in
        favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
        necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim).
        The arbitrator will have the authority to award fees and costs of
        attorneys, witnesses and experts to the extent permitted by the Terms of
        Use or Privacy Policy, the Administrator’s rules or applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        h. Right to Discovery: In addition to the parties’ rights to obtain
        discovery pursuant to the arbitration rules of the Administrator, either
        party may submit a written request to the arbitrator to expand the scope
        of discovery normally allowable under the arbitration rules of the
        Administrator. The arbitrator shall have discretion to grant or deny
        that request.
      </p>
      <p>
        i. Arbitration Result and Right of Appeal: Judgment upon the award given
        by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The
        arbitrator's decision is final and binding, except for any right of
        appeal provided by the FAA. The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited
        to deciding the case submitted by the parties to the arbitration.
        Therefore, no decision by any arbitrator shall serve as precedent in
        other arbitrations except in a dispute between the same parties, in
        which case it could be used to preclude the same claim from being
        re-arbitrated. If the amount of the Claim exceeds $25,000, any party
        can, within 30 days after the entry of the award by the arbitrator,
        appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the
        Administrator. (If an appeal is not filed within that time period, the
        arbitration award shall become final and binding). The panel shall
        reconsider de novo (anew) any aspect of the initial award requested by
        the appealing party. This means that they shall reach their own findings
        of fact and conclusions of law rather than deferring in any manner to
        the original arbitrator. The decision of the panel shall be by majority
        vote. Reference in this Arbitration Agreement to “the arbitrator” shall
        mean the panel if an appeal of the arbitrator’s decision has been taken.
        The costs of such an appeal will be borne in accordance with
        subparagraph (g) above, captioned “Cost of Arbitration.” Any final
        decision of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as

        j. Rules of Interpretation: This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the
        termination, cancellation, or suspension of the Terms of Use or Privacy
        Policy, any legal proceeding, and any bankruptcy by you, to the extent
        consistent with applicable bankruptcy law. In the event of a conflict or
        inconsistency between this Arbitration Agreement, on the one hand, and
        the applicable arbitration rules or the other provisions of the Terms of
        Use or Privacy Policy, on the other hand, this Arbitration Agreement
        shall govern. If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed
        invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the Terms of Use or
        Privacy Policy or the remaining portions of this Arbitration Agreement,
        except that:
      </p>
      <p>
        {"     "}(A) The parties acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is
        material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between them
        and is non-severable from this Arbitration Agreement. If the Class
        Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then this
        Arbitration Agreement (except for this sentence) shall be null and void
        with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the
        limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. The parties
        acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be
        arbitrated; and
      </p>
      <p>
        {"     "}(B) If a Claim is brought seeking public injunctive relief and
        a court determines that the restrictions in the Class Action Waiver or
        elsewhere in this Arbitration Agreement prohibiting the arbitrator from
        awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with
        respect to such Claim (and that determination becomes final after all
        appeals have been exhausted), the Claim for public injunctive relief
        will be determined in court and any individual Claims seeking monetary
        relief will be arbitrated. In such a case the parties will request that
        the court stay the Claim for public injunctive relief until the
        arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been entered in
        court. In no event will a Claim for public injunctive relief be
        arbitrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        l. Notice of Claim; Right to Resolve; Special Payment: Prior to
        initiating, joining or participating in any judicial or arbitration
        proceeding regarding any Claim, the Claimant (the party who asserts or
        seeks to assert a Claim in a lawsuit or arbitration proceeding) shall
        give the other party written notice of the Claim (a "Claim Notice") and
        a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 days, to resolve the Claim.
        Any Claim Notice you send must include your name, address, telephone
        number and loan or account number. Any Claim Notice must explain the
        nature of the Claim and the relief that is demanded. You may only submit
        a Claim Notice on your own behalf and not on behalf of any other party.
        The Claimant must reasonably cooperate in providing any information
        about the Claim that the other party reasonably requests. If: (i) you
        submit a Claim Notice in accordance with this paragraph on your own
        behalf (and not on behalf of any other party); (ii) we refuse to provide
        the relief you request before an arbitrator is appointed; and (iii) an
        arbitrator subsequently determines that you were entitled to such relief
        (or greater relief), the arbitrator shall award you at least $7,500 (not
        including any arbitration fees and attorneys' fees and costs to which
        you may be entitled under this Arbitration Agreement or applicable law).
        We encourage you to address all Claims you have in a single Claim Notice
        and/or a single arbitration. Accordingly, this $7,500 minimum award is a
        single award that applies to all Claims you have asserted or could have
        asserted in the arbitration, and multiple awards of $7,500 are not
        contemplated by this Section.
